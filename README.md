Foundational DevOps Concepts
DevOps is a collaborative approach that unifies software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to deliver high-quality software faster and more reliably. It breaks down silos between teams, encouraging shared responsibility, automation, and continuous improvement.

The core principles of DevOps include:
Collaboration: Developers and operations work together throughout the lifecycle.

Automation: Repetitive tasks like testing, integration, and deployment are automated to improve speed and accuracy.

Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD): Code is continuously integrated, tested, and deployed for faster feedback and delivery.

Monitoring and Feedback: Continuous monitoring provides real-time performance data, helping teams respond quickly to issues and improve systems.



DevOps Lifecycle Stages
Planning: Teams define project goals, timelines, and requirements. Tools like Jira or Trello help track progress.


Development: Developers write code based on the plan using collaboration tools and version control systems like Git.


Building: Code is compiled, dependencies are managed, and artifacts are created using tools like Maven or Gradle.


Testing: Automated tests (unit, integration, etc.) ensure code quality and catch bugs early.


Release: The software is prepared for production, with release notes and versioning applied.


Deployment: The application is deployed to production environments using automated tools like Jenkins or Kubernetes.


Operations: The system is managed in a live environment, focusing on performance, availability, and scalability.


Monitoring: Tools like Prometheus or New Relic track system health, performance, and user experience for ongoing improvement.
